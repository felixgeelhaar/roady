# Roady – Product Roadmap

## Guiding Principle

Roady evolves by **solving planning problems**, not by copying PM tools.

---

## Horizon 1 – Core Viability (Implemented)

Focus:
- Spec → Plan → Drift loop
- CLI stability
- MCP support
- Plugin framework

Outcome:
Roady usable solo and with AI tools.

---

## Horizon 2 – Core Depth (Implemented/Matured)

Focus:
- Better spec inference (Multi-file analyze)
- Drift classification (Categories & Hints)
- Performance
- Ecosystem plugins (GitHub Syncer Alpha)

Outcome:
Roady becomes trusted memory layer.

---

## Horizon 3 – Pro Foundations (Implemented/Matured)

Focus:
- Multi-user visibility (`roady timeline`)
- Ownership inference (Actor tracking)
- Status confidence (`verified` state + `evidence`)
- Governance foundations (Transition guards)

Outcome:
Clear separation of Core vs Pro.

---



## Horizon 4 – Organizational Intelligence (Implemented/Matured)



Focus:

- Cross-repo planning (Multi-workspace discovery - Implemented)

- AI governance (Policy-based token limits - Implemented)

- Compliance & auditability (Immutable event verification - Implemented)



Outcome:



Enterprise-ready planning standard.







---







## Horizon 5 – Adaptive Intelligence (Discovery)







Focus:



- Predictive Velocity (Using timeline/usage to forecast completion)



- Cross-repo Dependency Graph (Mapping intent across service boundaries)



- Planning Debt Analysis (Quantifying recurring drift patterns)







Outcome:







Proactive, data-driven planning assistant.















---















## Horizon 6 – Domain Hardening (Planning)















Focus:







- Value Object Ubiquity (Typed Estimates & Priorities)







- Internal Domain Events (Triggering side effects like auto-drift checks)







- Aggregate Consolidation (Unifying Intent and Reality)















Outcome:







Bulletproof architectural integrity.
