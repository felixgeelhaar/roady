## Interactive D3 MCP App Visualizations

Rich, browser-based D3.js charts embedded in all MCP apps. A shared d3-charts.ts library provides 6 reusable chart functions (donut, force-directed graph, arc gauge, horizontal bars, line chart, collapsible tree) used across 10 apps: status (donut), plan (force DAG), state (donut + swimlanes), drift (severity bars), debt (gauge + donut + bars + line), deps (force network), usage (token gauge), spec (feature tree), policy (compliance gauge), and git-sync (timeline). All charts include hover tooltips, click-to-filter, drag, and zoom interactions.
